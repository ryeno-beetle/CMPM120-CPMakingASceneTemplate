javascript notes?

ch2
- let usually does the same thing as var but secretly not always?? explained in ch3?
- const is a variable that isn't reassignable
- do {} while (); executes at least once


ch3
- [const/let] functionname = function(params) {};
- OR function functionname() {}; //function DECLARATION, which means it can be called above where it is declared (it will be moved during compiling), other way of defining functions doesn't do this
- arrow function:
	const functionname = (x) => {return something};
	const functionname = x => something;
	//these do one minor thing different from function expressions, explained in chapter 6
- let and const scope is block in which they were declared
- var scope is the function in which they were declared (or global if not in a function)
- call stack stores the places to return to when a thing is done executing (ex a function)
- javascript will ignore extra params, and set missing params to undefined
	- if you put = something after a param in function def, that will be default value if one isn't passed in
- closure: a function that references bindings from local scopes around it 
	- can return a definition of a new function that references the local var in original function, and this value will be saved when new function is called after it is returned
	- when called, function sees the environment in which it was created rather than the environment in which it was called


ch4
- access properties with . or []
	- obj.literal name
	- obj[evaluates this]
- == compares by identity; comparing different objects will return false even if they have the same properties
- triple dot operator:
	- rest parameter: ...var name as last param, will turn the rest of the parameters into a list
	- can spread out an array in function call like max(...numbers)
	- can spread out an array into another array like [1, ...numbers, 4]
